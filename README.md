This is Meowthon version 69.420.666 swag
====================================

Meowthon: Way Cooler than Python


## Features
- **Cowsay Print:** the original `print` function is boring. Let's fix that:

```bash
$ ./meowthon.exe
Meowthon 69.420.666swag
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
🍺| a = list(range(10))
🍺| print(a)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
\------------------/
 \  ^__^
  \ (oo)\________
    (__)\        )\/\
         ||----w||
         ||     ||
```
oh yes. the `>>>` prompt is replaced with a beer.

- **Nice Indexing:** some numbers are just very nice. Meowthon acknowledges them:
```bash
$ ./meowthon.exe
🍺| a = list(range(100))
🍺| a[69]
Nice! 👌
69
🍺| a[420]
Blaze it, homie
420
```
